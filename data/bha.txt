### **Details**  
Branksome Hall Asia opened on October 15, 2012, as the third international school in Jeju Global Education City. It offers education from kindergarten to high school and graduated its first cohort in 2015. Along with Chadwick International in Songdo, it offers the IB program across all grades.  

Commonly referred to as "BHA" or "Branks" among students, the school transitioned from an all-girls school to a coeducational system, prompting significant changes in campus facilities.  

Unlike other international schools in Korea where students must take GED exams for domestic university eligibility, Branksome Hall Asia is accredited by Korea’s Ministry of Education. Students take Korean language and history courses, allowing them to pursue both domestic and international university options upon graduation.  

Following the IB curriculum, the school is divided into:  
- **PYP**: Junior Kindergarten to Grade 5  
- **MYP**: Grades 6 to 10  
- **DP**: Grades 11 to 12  

Boarding is optional but available starting in MYP. Day students can use the school bus system upon request.  

The school mascot is a bear, and its motto is "BRANKSOME BEARS."
