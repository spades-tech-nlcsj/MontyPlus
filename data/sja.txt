### **2. Education**  

#### **Educational Vision: Inquiry/Project-Based Learning (IPBL)**  
SJA Jeju’s core educational approach, *Inquiry Project-Based Learning (IPBL)*, encourages students to ask questions and solve problems through self-directed, “bottom-up” learning. This method culminates in the **Capstone Program**, which integrates skills acquired throughout the curriculum. Through Capstone, students choose topics of interest, conduct in-depth research, analyze solutions, and present their results, showcasing their academic achievements and fostering expertise in specific fields.  

Key elements include:  
- Integrating core subjects into project-based learning.  
- Connecting Capstone projects to real-world challenges in local, national, and international contexts.  
- Developing character, inquiry skills, and a sense of community.
